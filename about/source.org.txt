(Jeff) Why must I have:

  - a timestamp in the LOGBOOK
  - a CREATED property

Isn't the date the issue was closed enough?

- [ ] Fork the project
- [ ] Fix the timezone assertion error
- [ ] Breaks if timestamps are active
- [ ] If can't find something in one entry, it flows over into the next one

Ask:

- [ ] why ust I have a LOGBOOK when CLOSED holds the timestamp it is finished?
- [ ] so why do I need a CREATED property?
- [ ] why not default the ID to the timestamp of when it was closed + the title?
- [ ] need a hotkey to regenerate the blog!
